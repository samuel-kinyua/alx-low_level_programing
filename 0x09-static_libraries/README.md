# 0x09 static libraries

#tasks
create a static library called libmy.a

write a bash script create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

#resources 
main.h
mylib.a
create_static_lib.sh

#My thoughts
This projects makes use of the knowledge of static libraries in c programing aswell as application to bash scripting.
